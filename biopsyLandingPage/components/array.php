$biopsyProcess=[

    ["1. Preparation Phase :","The process is explained to the patient, and any prerequisites—such as fasting or stopping particular medications are made."],
    ["2. Anesthesia :","Local anaesthetic may be used to numb the area, or sedation/general anaesthesia may be required for more invasive operations, depending on the type of biopsy and the location of the tissue sample."],
    ["3. Positioning :","The patient is positioned appropriately to access the biopsy site comfortably."],
    ["4. Sterilization :","The skin over the biopsy site is cleaned and sterilized to reduce the risk of infection.</br> Guidance (if applicable): For certain types of biopsies, such as image-guided biopsies, imaging techniques like ultrasound,</br> MRI, or CT scan may be used to precisely locate the target tissue."],
    ["5. Biopsy Instrument Insertion :","A specialized tool, such as a needle, punch tool, or surgical instrument, is used to access the tissue sample."],
    ["6. Sample Collection :","The biopsy instrument collects a small sample of tissue from the target area. In needle biopsies, a syringe may be attached to withdraw fluid or tissue."],
    ["7. Hemostasis (if necessary) :","Any bleeding from the biopsy site is controlled using pressure, cauterization, or other hemostatic techniques."],
    ["8. Specimen Handling :","The collected tissue sample is carefully handled to preserve its integrity and prevent contamination."],
    ["9. Closure (if applicable) :","Depending on the type of biopsy, the incision site may be closed with sutures, staples, or adhesive strips."],
    ["10. Post-Procedure Care :","The patient is monitored for any immediate complications, and instructions for post-procedure care, such as wound care and activity restrictions, are provided."],
    ["11. Follow-up :","The biopsy sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis by a pathologist. Results are communicated to the patient by the healthcare provider, and further treatment or additional testing may be recommended based on the biopsy findings."]
